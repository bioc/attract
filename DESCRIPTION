Title: Methods to Find the Gene Expression Modules that Represent the
        Drivers of Kauffman's Attractor Landscape

Description: This package contains the functions to find the gene
        expression modules that represent the drivers of Kauffman's
        attractor landscape. The modules are the core attractor
        pathways that discriminate between different cell types of
        groups of interest. Each pathway has a set of synexpression
        groups, which show transcriptionally-coordinated changes in
        gene expression.
